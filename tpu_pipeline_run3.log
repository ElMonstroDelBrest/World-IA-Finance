[Thu Feb 19 06:35:54 UTC 2026] === Sync ArrayRecord from GCS ===

WARNING: gsutil rsync uses hashes when modification time is not available at
both the source and destination. Your crcmod installation isn't using the
module's C extension, so checksumming will run very slowly. If this is your
first rsync since updating gsutil, this rsync can take significantly longer than
usual. For help installing the extension, please see "gsutil help crcmod".
